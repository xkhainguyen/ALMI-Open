## TODO
- [x] Release ALMI training code
- [ ] Release ALMI deployment code
- [x] Release ALMI-X dataset collection code
- [x] Release ALMI-X foundation model training code
- [x] Release ALMI-X foundation model's checkpoint and inference code

## Overview

In this repository, we release "ALMI policy training code" in `ALMI_RL`, "ALMI-X dataset collection code" in `Data_Collection`, "ALMI-X foundation model training and inference code" in `ALMI_trans`. Please refer to [ALMI_RL](/ALMI_RL/README.md), [Data_Collection](/Data_Collection/README.md) and [ALMI_trans](/ALMI_trans/README.md) for installation and usage. You can also download our trained foundation model checkpoints at [ALMI-trans](https://huggingface.co/TeleEmbodied/ALMI-trans)
